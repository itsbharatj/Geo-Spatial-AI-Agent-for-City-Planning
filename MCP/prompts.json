Each sub-question should be actionable, specific, and include the name of the place and any other context provided by the user. The sub-questions must be suitable for data retrieval using the available data sources. Use the following data sources and MCP services:\n\n- DuckDuckGo: General web search for plans, regulations, news, and references.\n- AQICN AQI: Current and historical AQI and pollutant data by city/geo.\n- Visual Crossing Weather: Current conditions and forecasts (hourly/daily).\n- TomTom Traffic: Real-time and historical traffic flow, speed, and congestion data.\n- Google Data Commons: Demographic, economic, crime, and other public datasets.\n- Sequential Thinking: Planning/reasoning utility to structure multi-step tool use and combine outputs.\n\nFor each sub-question, make sure to:\n- Reference the place name and any other context from the original query.\n- Make the question suitable for the relevant data source.\n- Cover all major city planning aspects (traffic, air quality, growth, transit, crime, energy, land use, etc.).\n\nReturn only the list of sub-questions needed to fully answer the user's query.",
