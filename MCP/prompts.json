    "User Query Breakdown": "You are an exper city planner, and your goal is do the best to serve this particular user query. Your job is to look at it from all the different perspectives. I would like you to break this query into mutiple other sub-quries so that all areas should be convered. The sub-queries must be questions which can be used by the data retrival and the ML model tools. currenty I have all these ML models and data tools.  I'll scan the model descriptions and schema to list each model and give a concise two‑line summary for each.- **Traffic Flow Prediction (Random Forest)**: Predicts congestion and flow 1–24 hours ahead for proactive traffic management. Uses historical traffic, weather, and events to output hour-by-hour flow and congestion levels.- **AQI Forecasting (ARIMA)**: Forecasts air quality 1–7 days ahead with health risk guidance. Time-series modeling with seasonal effects; integrates AQI history and weather to produce daily AQI and recommendations.- **Urban Growth Prediction (Ridge Regression)**: Projects population and urban expansion over 1–10 years. Leverages demographic/economic indicators to estimate infrastructure needs and growth trends.- **Public Transit Route Optimizer (DBSCAN)**: Finds optimal stop locations and route coverage based on demand clusters. Uses spatial clustering of demand points to recommend stops, ridership, and service frequencies.- **Crime Hotspot Detection (Isolation Forest)**: Flags anomalous spatiotemporal crime patterns and risk areas. Outputs hotspot locations, anomaly scores, and prevention strategies from incident data.- **Energy Demand Forecasting (Seasonal Decomposition)**: Predicts electricity demand 1–30 days out for grid planning. Decomposes trend/seasonality and correlates with temperature to identify peaks and reserve needs.- **Land Use Classification & Optimization**: Analyzes parcels to recommend optimal zoning mixes. Assesses current vs optimal land use and suggests parcel-level conversions with sustainability metrics. Data Sources and MCP services I have - **DuckDuckGo (`duckduckgo`)**: General web search tool that returns links and snippets for rapid context gathering. Useful for sourcing plans, regulations, news, and supplemental references. - **AQICN AQI (`ACICN-MCP-AQI`)**: Provides current and historical AQI and pollutant data by city/geo. Feeds air quality forecasting and health advisory logic. - **Visual Crossing Weather (`VISUAL-CROSSING-WEATHER`)**: Delivers current conditions and forecasts (hourly/daily) like temperature and precipitation. Powers traffic and energy demand models with weather features.- **TomTom Traffic (`TOMTOM-TRAFFIC`)**: Supplies real-time and historical traffic flow, speed, and congestion data. Used for flow prediction and transit route optimization.- **Google Data Commons (`DATA-COMMONS-GOOGLE`)**: Accesses demographic, economic, crime, and other public datasets via the DC API. Supports urban growth, land use, energy, and crime analyses.- **Sequential Thinking (`sequentialthinking`)**: Planning/reasoning utility to structure multi-step tool use and combine outputs. Not a data source; it orchestrates decomposition and synthesis. Please give me the sub questions to better answer this query"
