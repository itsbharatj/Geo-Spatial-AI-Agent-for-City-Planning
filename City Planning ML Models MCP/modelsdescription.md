- Issue timely health advisories to vulnerable populations
- Implement temporary traffic restrictions during predicted high pollution days
- Plan industrial activity schedules to minimize pollution impact
- Guide long-term air quality improvement strategies

**Key Outputs:**
- Daily AQI predictions with confidence intervals
- Health risk categories and recommendations
- Model performance metrics for reliability assessment

**Purpose:** Projects population growth and urban expansion over 1-10 years, crucial for infrastructure planning.

**How it Works:**
- Ridge Regression handles multicollinear factors (GDP, employment, built area)
- Projects population based on economic indicators and land use
- Calculates infrastructure needs automatically based on population projections
- Accounts for planned infrastructure projects

**Data Integration:**
- **Data Commons Google:** Provides census, economic, and demographic data
- **DuckDuckGo:** Can search for infrastructure plans and development proposals

- Plan water and power infrastructure capacity
- Guide zoning decisions based on projected growth
- Budget for future public services

**Key Outputs:**
- Year-by-year population projections
- Infrastructure requirements (schools, hospitals, parks, water capacity)
- Growth rate trends and economic impact coefficients

- **Data Commons Google:** Population density and demographic information
- **Sequential Thinking:** Helps optimize complex route networks

**Use Cases for City Planners:**
- Design new bus/metro routes based on actual demand
- Optimize existing routes for better coverage
- Identify underserved areas needing transit access
- Plan park-and-ride facilities at optimal locations

**Key Outputs:**
- Optimal stop locations with GPS coordinates
- Expected ridership at each stop
- Service frequency recommendations
- Coverage efficiency metrics

### **5. Crime Hotspot Detection Model (Isolation Forest)**

**Purpose:** Identifies unusual crime patterns and predicts high-risk areas for targeted intervention.

**How it Works:**
- Isolation Forest detects anomalous spatiotemporal crime patterns
- Identifies areas with statistically unusual crime concentrations
- Classifies risk levels based on anomaly scores
- Generates prevention strategies based on pattern types

**Data Integration:**
- **Data Commons Google:** Crime statistics and demographic data
- **DuckDuckGo:** Can search for local crime reports and patterns
- **Sequential Thinking:** Analyzes complex crime pattern relationships

**Use Cases for City Planners:**

- Install security infrastructure (lighting, CCTV) strategically

**Key Outputs:**
- Hotspot locations with risk levels
- Anomaly scores indicating pattern unusualness
- Crime prevention strategy recommendations
- Statistical analysis of crime distribution

### **6. Energy Demand Forecasting Model (Seasonal Decomposition)**

**Purpose:** Predicts electricity demand 1-30 days ahead for grid management and capacity planning.

**How it Works:**
- Decomposes demand into trend, seasonal, and residual components
- Correlates demand with temperature and day types
- Identifies peak hours and seasonal patterns
- Calculates required reserve capacity with safety margins

**Data Integration:**
- **Visual Crossing Weather:** Temperature forecasts that drive demand
- **Data Commons Google:** Historical energy consumption data
- **Sequential Thinking:** Helps plan complex grid scenarios
